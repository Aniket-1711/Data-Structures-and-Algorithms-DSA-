# 📚 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

> A comprehensive collection of Data Structure and Algorithm problems with detailed solutions, explanations, and complexity analysis.

## 🎯 Repository Structure

This repository contains **folders for each problem I solve**, making it easy to navigate and find specific solutions. Each problem is organized in its own dedicated folder with comprehensive documentation.

## 📁 Folder Organization

Each problem folder contains:

### 🔧 Main Code Files
- **Detailed explanations** of the approach and logic
- **Edge cases** consideration and handling
- **Complexity analysis** (Time and Space)
- Clean, well-commented code with proper formatting

### 🌟 Additional Solutions File
Each folder includes a **"possible other solutions"** file that contains:
- 🚀 **Brute Force Solutions**: Straightforward approaches for understanding
- ⚡ **Optimized Solutions**: Efficient algorithms with better complexity
- 🌐 **Alternative Approaches**: Other known solutions (including research from internet)
- 📖 **Comparison Analysis**: When to use which approach

This makes it **easy to revise later** and compare different approaches for the same problem!

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Problem-focused organization** - Each folder = One problem  
✅ **Multiple solution approaches** - From brute force to optimal  
✅ **Detailed documentation** - Understand the 'why' behind each solution  
✅ **Complexity analysis** - Know the performance characteristics  
✅ **Edge case handling** - Robust solutions that handle corner cases  
✅ **Easy revision** - Quick comparison of different approaches  

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse by Problem**: Navigate to the specific problem folder you're interested in
2. **Study the Main Solution**: Start with the main code file for the primary approach
3. **Explore Alternatives**: Check the "possible other solutions" file for different approaches
4. **Understand Complexity**: Review the time and space complexity analysis
5. **Practice Edge Cases**: See how different edge cases are handled


## 🎨 Code Quality Standards

- **Clean Code**: Well-formatted, readable code with meaningful variable names
- **Comprehensive Comments**: Detailed explanations of logic and approach
- **Visual Organization**: Section headers and organized structure for easy reading
- **Multiple Approaches**: Different solutions with trade-off analysis
